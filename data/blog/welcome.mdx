As we start releasing new programs and departments, we will start to showcase our work on this blog. But that's not all! Expect plenty of tips, and tricks.

We have gained lots of valuable experience since 2015, and we are estatic with the idea to be able to share all that with you.

Our goal is to bring a variety of posts, from showcasing our achievments, to tips or tricks, and our personal experience in running a Non-Profit.

Make sure to follow us if you’d like to stay tuned for exciting posts in the future!
